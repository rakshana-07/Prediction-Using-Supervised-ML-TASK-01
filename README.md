# Student Performance Prediction

This project involves predicting a student's percentage based on the number of study hours. It is a simple linear regression task with two variables: study hours and percentage. You can use tools like Python (with scikit-learn), R, SAS Enterprise Miner, or any other suitable tool.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found at [http://bit.ly/w-data](http://bit.ly/w-data). It contains two columns: "Hours" (the number of study hours) and "Scores" (the corresponding student percentage).

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `student_performance.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook or script containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset file(s).
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your Python environment:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (for data visualization)

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
https://github.com/rakshana-07/Prediction-Using-Supervised-Model-TASK-01
```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or script `prediction using supervised model.ipynb` to execute the code.

3. The notebook/script will load the dataset, train a linear regression model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions.

4. View the results, including the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the predicted score for a student studying 9.25 hours per day.

## Results

After running the code, you will obtain the following results:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): X.XX (an evaluation metric for model performance).
- Predicted score for a student studying 9.25 hours per day: XX.XX
